# spotify-transfer

A very simple WIP script to move songs from a playlist into your `favorite songs` list in the spotify desktop client for windows. Install autohotkey, place the script anywhere you'd like, run it, and then navigate to your spotify desktop client. Open the desired playlist, manually add all the songs at the bottom so that the next song to add is at the top of the scroll window. Navigate via arrow keys so that this song is the only unfavorited song visible. Place the cursor over the heart icon, and press `Win + Space`. This starts the script. It will add all the songs in the playlist. Press `Win + z` to pause the script, or when it has finished. It is not completely error free, as it may skip songs if the spotify client is lagging. Then navigate to the systray to close the AHK script.
